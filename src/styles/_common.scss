/*

_common.scss

Add here styles that are applied to different components. This part could be in a folder if you want
to structure it better, for example, let's say we have this:

- Grid classes (.row, .container, .col-xx-xx, ...)
- Helpers with specific purposes (.hidden-xx, .text-left, .text-right, .text-center, ...)
- Among others...

In this case, you can add another folder with all the files you need, but those still don't belong to any
module/component.
