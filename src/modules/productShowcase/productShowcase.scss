/**

productShowcase.scss (A.K.A. The Module)

The important part here is to follow BEM as much as possible. Each project has different people
and that people should decide what parts are acceptable and what are not. Also, how to structure
the css in this part is a decision more than a "MUST TO FOLLOW" rule.

*/

// First approach: Using 'this' (&)
// Some people like this approach because it's cleaner and you don't need to repeat the base name.
// Personally, I don't dislike this one, it's just that I don't like the excessive embed that it can
// produce.
.product-showcase {
  &__title {

  }

  &__text {

  }

  &__button {

  }
}

// Second approach: Old fashion CSS selectors
// What I like of this approach is that I can do a global find and go to the selector very quickly (this can be
// done with the approach above too), and reduces the embedding to the maximum. That's it. Use whatever you decide
// to use.

// Here we're gonna add the real code for this module
.product-showcase {
  background: color('guardsman-red');
  color: color('alabaster');
  padding: 25px 0;
}

.product-showcase__title {
  margin-top: 0;
  font-size: 26px; // Why px and not other crazy size unit like rem or em?
}

.product-showcase__text {
  font-size: 14px;
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin-bottom: 30px;
}

.product-showcase__button {
  background-color: #37474F;
  color: color(alabaster);
}
